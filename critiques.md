### Critiques for the Course
---

1. VM Connectivity and latency is garbage
2. Kali VM's are literally unusable. Turned a "120 minute" exercise into an all-day affair.  
2. Little to no feedback on exercises
3. Writing down exercise answers is **NOT** "keeping good op notes" 
4. Instructor turnover is getting a bit out of hand - six instructors in an eight week course? Come on.   
5. Why have us use the same VTE for all of mod one and then switch to separate VTEs for every exercise. I'd rather just have a unique environment for every exercise, or group them by exercise. ie, VTE EX 1-1-2 and 1-1-3  
6. I understand the goal of the course is to create self-starting analysts, but the level of "figure it out yourself" is ridiculous. Why even have the instructors honestly, all they do is move us from exercise to exercise.  
7. I hated the capstone. Useless waste of time.  


"I'm going to give you not a lot of guidance" then why are you here?  

"It's a real world situation" No it isn't. It's a class.  


__critiques for instructors__  

Mr. Smith  
His "figure it out yourself" method doesn't work in a virtual class. It just ended with me giving up on the exercises he was "faciliating" because it was too much of being thrown in the deep end. I think he would be a fine in person instructor, but I didn't learn anything from him in the virtual environment. This could've been because that's just how Mod 5 is, but it was a tough week.     

Mr. Herbert  
Mr. Herbert was great. Wish we had him and Mr. Crew the whole course. Enjoyed the split between talking/working and he was able to prep us for exams fairly well.  

Mr. Crew  
Again, enjoyed the split between talking and working. If only he was our instructor the whole course...  

Mr. Denton  
Taught mods 1 and 6. He was great prepping us for the mod 6 exam and the exercise review. He seems to understand the volatility of the expected results and technical difficulties that we go through which I appreciate.
