### Critiques for the Course
---

1. VM Connectivity and latency is garbage
2. Kali VM's are literally unusable. Turned a "120 minute" exercise into an all-day affair.  
2. Little to no feedback on exercises
3. Writing down exercise answers is **NOT** "keeping good op notes" 
4. Instructor turnover is getting a bit out of hand  
5. Why have us use the same VTE for all of mod one and then switch to separate VTEs for every course. I'd rather just have a unique environment for every exercise, or group them by exercise. ie, VTE EX 1-1-2 and 1-1-3
