![Alt text](image/ex3-2map2.png)

Question 6  
You are in Workgroup 1 and the following actions occur:

You connect to your internal SharePoint and download a document.
You email it to a coworker in Workgroup 2. (Assume coworker pulled email)
Your coworker proceeds to upload it to the webserver.

Follow the path of the network traffic that was created and count the number of hops. What is the total number of hops? (Hops include routers and endpoints.)

13 hops  

Question 7  
Does Workgroup 2 have access to Workgroup 3?  
Yes, the VPN connection between D and C allows access to Workgroup 3.  

Question 8  
Workgroup 1 and 2 want to create an FTP server and a database that both are allowed to access but would not allow access to Workgroup 3.  

What would be the best way to accomplish this?
Connect a firewall internal to G, connect a switch to that firewall, and connect the FTP server and database to the switch. (As the VPN connection would be coming inbound the firewall could block all inbound VPN traffic)  

Question 9   
By analyzing web traffic at Routers A and B, it is discovered that ransomware was attempted to be delivered by exploiting a vulnerability in version 1.0.2.8 Firewall OS. Firewall C had not been updated before the attack, but Firewall D was updated. Using the provided diagram, determine what workgroups could be affected by the attack.  
Only Workgroup 3 could be affected because the firewall D was updated.  

Question 10  
A Workgroup 1 user is downloading a file from Workgroup 3 with no issue, however, a user from Workgroup 3 is unable to download a file from Workgroup 1. Workgroup 1 is also not able to access the internet. What is most likely the issue?  
Workgroup 1 switch is misconfigured.

### Scenario 1  
---
An internal workstation was identified as having accessed unauthorized documents on an internal file server on the network. The customer wants to monitor the workstation for anymore unauthorized activity.  

IP Address: 192.168.100.34  

MAC Address: 00:01:33:FA:B1:03  

Question 31  
List the possible locations for sensor placement and the problems or considerations at each location.  
Router 1 - Will see all traffic  
Switch 4 - will only monitor the servers  
switch 2 - will monitor all workstations  
 
Question 32  
Which filter would you place on the sniffer, an IP address or a MAC address? Why?  
IP address. Less volatile/not in flux  

Question 33  
Which ports/protocols would you use?  
Monitor for SMB/FTP/HTTP/TFTP

Question 34  
Based on what is provided, what other questions would you ask the network engineer or the system administrator?


### Scenario 2  
---
The customer has reported that their website has been defaced with anti-government material. The website is hosted on a server that is connected to the DMZ segment of the firewall. Reviewing the IIS logs, there are suspicious web requests from the IP address 214.3.152.67. It is suspected that the defacement came from that IP address. You are in charge of collecting data from the sensors and must decide from which sensors to collect data. Use the document and map provided to answer the following questions.  

Question 35  
What are the possible in-line sensors that you can collect data of value from that is related to the defacement?  
Firewall01 may have logs relating to the incident  

Question 36  
Are there any other sensors of interest? Why?  
No, there are no other sensors  

Question 37  
What additional questions would you ask the network engineer or system administrator?  


### Scenario 3
---
The customer states that a person is using a workstation on Switch 01 and is performing suspicious actions against the Victim Server on Switch 04.  

![Alt text](image/ex3-3map4.png)  

Question 38  
Using the local organic sensors, why is Switch 01 the best placement option?  
If the customer believes the suspicious activity is from Switch 01, tapping here will allow us to receive all traffic from the suspicious hosts.  

Question 39  
If it is determined that the subject has access to a remote VPN account, how does this change the answer for the best placement?  
If the malicious actor has remote access, tapping at Switch01 will no longer allow us to see the relevant traffic.

### Scenario 4
---
The subject is now an unknown attacker coming from the Internet. The arrow pointing to the firewall indicating a bad location is placed in both examples to emphasize that a CPT member should never try to place a network monitor directly into any firewall or router. In this example, both Switch 05 and Switch 03 are good locations to place a monitor.   
![Alt text](image/ex3-3map5.png)  

Question 40   
Why would Switch 05 be a better location to monitor than Switch 03? What could be some benefits of monitoring Switch 03?  
Switch05 will allow us to view all traffic coming into the network from the internet. A benefit of Switch03 is that the traffic will be a more narrow scope allowing us to fixate specifically on the traffic to the servers.  

### Scenario 5
---
An air traffic controller, using workstation 10.5.6.14, recently reported that her system may have been compromised. The user reported that she had been conducting research on the internet when she noticed her cursor acting in an erratic manner. After a few moments, a text file opened on the desktop and the following message was displayed: “You have been hacked!”  
![Alt text](image/ex3-3map6.png)  

Question 41  
Using the network map and the information provided, identify the IP address of the first witness device that may contain data pertaining to this incident.  
10.0.1.1

Question 42  
Using the network map and the information provided, identify the IP address of the second witness device that may contain data pertaining to this incident.  
10.0.1.3  

Question 43  
Using the network map and the information provided, identify the IP address of the third witness device that may contain data pertaining to this incident.  
10.0.1.14

Question 44  
Using the network map and the information provided, identify the IP address of the fourth witness device that may contain data pertaining to this incident.  
10.0.1.4


### Scenario 6
---
You received an alert that someone has been posting fighter maintenance records and images of fighters on a website for civilian military enthusiasts. You examined the images and determined they are pictures of aircraft assigned to Victorville Air Base. You visited the website and were able to verify that an air frame mechanic assigned to the fighter maintenance unit at Victorville Air Base uploaded the information. Upon further investigation, you found evidence of data being exfiltrated from both facility fighter sections. You have been assigned to collect network traffic to determine if any other data is being exfiltrated from the unit.  
![Alt text](image/ex3-3map7.png)

Question 45  
Using the network map and the information provided, identify the IP address of the BEST location to install your network monitor.

### Scenario 1: Ninety-Two Pines Marine Air Ground Base
---
The Equation Group hacking tools were leaked by third party Shadow Brokers. These hacking tools have been used to infect Windows machines worldwide. Yesterday, intelligence officials indicated that several government agency computers and servers have been infected, citing multiple reports of possible breaches targeting Windows 2KR2 Servers and Windows unpatched with remedies. As a result, an initial scan of network traffic and firewall logs (10.0.1.18) found that a host machine (10.57.4.3) is sending/receiving encrypted traffic to/from the 10.57.6.131 (server). Additionally, firewall logs from (10.0.1.18) indicate 445 traffic from the server IP to the host IP.  

Restrictions  
The supported commander does not want any network downtime.  

Simulated Equipment
- 1/10/100G in-line splitter
- 10 GB network tap
- 100/1000 copper Ethernet cables
- 1 x 24 port switch (auto sensing, 10/100/1000 Mbps, video-streaming capable)
- 1 x router
- Supported command's local resources

![Alt text](image/ex3-4map1.png)

Question 1  
Private Hawker, located at Ninety-Two Pines Marine Air Ground Base, wants to either tap the router at 10.0.1.11 or reconfigure the IDS to do full capture. What are the pros and cons of each course of action?  
TAP router is off the table - customer does not want downtime. Adding a SPAN port on the router will get the job done. They already have a SPAN to the IDS - why can't we just plug in there?

About the full capture - works great, lives off the land. BUT requires loads of space.  


Question 2  
What is the purpose of capturing traffic on switch 10.0.1.10, since the packet from the host to the server does not ever transverse to that switch? Why do we want to see traffic from the external internet and internal devices?  
The C2 MUST be external


Question 3  
Private Hawker wants to know if tapping that port mirror/span port line between 10.0.1.10 and 10.0.1.14 will cause any network downtime. Would tapping that line cause network downtime? Why or Why not?  
Yes, tapping will cause network downtime


Question 4  
Private Hawker states that she wants to configure a span port on switch 10.57.4.2. Would this be a good idea? Why or Why not?  
No - we have limited taps and this is a waste

Question 5  
Private Hawker wants to configure a span port on switch 10.57.6.2. What information would this provide you as an analyst?  
This would provide traffic going to/from the servers


Question 6   
Private Hawker wants to use and configure the HBSS on the .3 host machine (local defender’s software) in order to monitor for threat activity. Why would it be important to use organic capabilities before we use our own?  
If we use our own tools, the threat actor may notice the change in the network  


Question 7  
Private Hawker wants to know why she has to monitor the network and make observations instead of immediately removing the malware from the host machine. Why is it important to monitor the network and make observations before containing and eradicating the malicious actor’s activity?  
You can only be sure the malware didn't replicate or the actor didn't move laterally if you watch the traffic. We need to monitor it. Triage it.    



### Scenario 2
---
The DCI intelligence analyst has found an intel report from NSA NTOC. The report suggests that a foreign cyber espionage organization has possibly compromised the Ninety-Two Pines Marine Air Ground Base classified network. The whole base is currently supporting a mission that requires 24-hour operations. The intelligence report is provided below, along with other guidance for this scenario.  

Question 8  
Private Hawker doesn't have any experience in a live network intrusion. Based on the information previously given, provide a sensor strategy describing the best location to place new sensors and which local resources will be re-purposed/configured.

Develop a sensor strategy describing the best location to place new sensors and which local resources will be re-purposed/configured in the space below. Your sensor strategy can be written below in any template or format you want. Pay special attention to the impact of your decisions. Thoroughly explain why you are making these changes in the sensor strategy.  




### Scenario 3
---
A new threat report issued by Mandiant Cyber Security Consulting Services | FireEye regarding new TTPs for APT1 was released today. According to Mandiant’s investigation, for the past five months, APT1 has gained access and compromised several DoD organizations. During the last two months, APT1 has been observed stealing 10.5 GB of compressed data from several technology- and DoD-contracting companies that support the U. S. Military Weapons Program. This also includes APT1’s compromise of PROJECT REAPER networks, which includes emails and sensitive documents for the U.S. Long Range Stealth Strike Bomber (LRSS-B) and U.S. Navy Advanced Attack Submarine SSN(X).  

As a result, several Cyber Protection teams have been ordered to ensure all critical infrastructure assets are protected, and to search for APT1 IOCs on the network. The supported command has provided a network map with their mission critical assets highlighted in RED. The CTE team has provided an APT1-specific attack diagram with the most likely course of action.  

Question 9  
Using the map and based on the COA 1 in the attack diagram provided by the CTE team, what is the best sensor placement position, if your team only has two network sensors? Why?  


Question 10  
Using the same resources, what is the best sensor placement position if your team only has one network sensor? Why?  



Question 11  
Using the same resources, what is the best sensor placement position, if your team only has one network sensor and two host sensors? Why?

### Scenario

Analyzing network traffic is a critical skill for an intrusion analyst. While we've looked at network traffic from aggregate perspectives (netflow, network statistics by host, etc.), we have yet to conduct more in-depth analysis of network traffic. In this exercise, you will have the opportunity to use more advanced searching and extraction capabilities in Wireshark to analyze network traffic and the artifacts contained within.  

During this exercise, you will gain proficiency analyzing network traffic and web traffic to discover foretelling information and locate prescient artifacts, extract the specific artifact, and conduct follow-on analysis of the artifact.

Question 1  
Use Wireshark to analyze the provided pcap and extract the file yikr9jXET.jpg. Once you have identified and extracted the image, enter the validation code.  
frame contains yikr9jXET.jpg  
JpgImageFromWireshark

Question 2  
Use Wireshark to analyze the provided pcap and extract the PNG image file transferred over HTTP with an IP in the 68.85.0.0/16 network. Once you have identified and extracted the image, enter the validation code.  
Note: Even when files are misnamed you can often identify the file type by a file signature similar to how the Linux/UNIX utility libmagic works.  
ip.addr == 68.85.0.0/16  
q9Xik-rTnw.bin
PngBy5ignature  

Question 3  
Use Wireshark to identify the downloaded executable masquerading as a Windows update. What is the name of the file that was downloaded?  
Windows updates use a ".msu" file extension. By using frame contains .msu, we can identify this. This search leads us to a packet with a MZP - zipped. Containing UPX.  SUS  

### Scenario Update 1  
The local cyber defense capability received an intrusion detection system alert identifying an unknown User Agent string leaving the defended network.  
http.user_agent == "XXX"  

Question 4  
Analyze the traffic associated with the User Agent string "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.0.1288)" provided by the local defenders.  
What do you suspect the client operating system is?  

Question 5  
Do you believe the impacted client has AntiVirus installed? If yes, what vendor?  

Question 6  
What value is used to uniquely identify the client?  



### Scenario 2
The network defenders were able to identify the malware running on the client and have restored the system to a known good state. Use what you learned from the command and control to identify other hosts that may be impacted by a similar strain of malware.  

Note: Malware may morph over time and take on new characteristics of methods of obfuscating information. You may want to learn more about obfuscation techniques commonly used by threat agents.


Question 7  
Find another command and control interaction likely attributed to the same malware. What is the version of the suspected malware running on the second client?  

Question 8  
The last command and control interaction by the malware refers to an additional IP address. What is that IP address? 

Question 9  
Is there any indication that communication with that IP address was successful?  


## Exercise 3-3-12 Analyze a Host to Identify Threat Activity  

The exercise says to use GRR, but GRR is busted on these VM's. Everything will isntead be done with powershell! Yippee!  

Remote 1  
172.16.12.5  
Administrator / DC3P@ssw0rd

Remote 2  
172.16.12.3  
Administrator / DC3P@ssw0rd

Question 1  
Use GRR to perform analysis on the first system. GRR has already been installed on the system in question and can be accessed through the web interface. You do not need to reconfigure the GRR Server for this exercise.  
Use GRR to perform analysis on Windows Remote 1 system. Which malicious binaries are found on the Windows system? (Select all that apply.)  
`Get-ChildItem -Path C:\ -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force | where name -in ("chr0me.exe","extension.exe", "FileHunter-Win32.exe", "server.pem")`  

extension.exe  
FileHunter-Win32.exe


Question 2  
Use GRR to perform analysis on the first system. GRR has already been installed on the system in question and can be accessed through the web interface. You do not need to reconfigure the GRR Server for this exercise.  
Use GRR to answer the following question. Based on the previous two malicious binaries, did they establish persistence within the registry?  

__No__  
Yes, in the HKLM Run Key  
Yes, in the HKCU Run Key  
Yes, in Borland\Delphi\Locales  


Question 3  
First System Analysis  
Use GRR to perform analysis on the first system. GRR has already been installed on the system in question and can be accessed through the web interface. You do not need to reconfigure the GRR Server for this exercise.   
Use GRR to retrieve the hashes of the two malicious binaries previously found. Using the hashes, classify the type of malware the binaries are.  \

`get-filehash c:\path`    

Note: Using VirusTotal to check for malicious files is not a best practice. Many adversaries monitor VirusTotal in order to see if their malicious activity has been detected.    

__Adware__  
APT1 Threat  
Keylogger  
Ransomware  


Question 4  
Second System Analysis

## Exercise 3-3-15 Characterize a Suspicious File  

[Malwarebytes Window Portable Executable (PE) Analysis Tools](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2014/05/five-pe-analysis-tools-worth-looking-at)  
[Structure of a Portable Executable (Graphic)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Portable_Executable_32_bit_Structure.png)  
[Structure of a Portable Executable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format?redirectedfrom=MSDN)  


Question 1  
What type of file are you analyzing?  

NOTE: Get the corresponding sample from the resources drive and copy to your VM’s desktop. You may use any tool within the Malware Tools folder located on the computer.  
.xex   

Question 2  
Does the file extension match the file type?  
No    

Question 3  
Is the file packed? If no, type “No.” If yes, what packer was used?  
yes - UPX was used. We can see this in the "hex" section of filealyzer.  

Question 4  
Calculate the MD5 of the compressed sample. What are the last 4 digits of the MD5?  
944207B205C5FA4162B31C34309EB1B0  

Question 5  
Unpack the sample with an appropriate unpacking utility. Calculate the MD5 of the decompressed sample.  
What are the last four characters of the MD5?  
Using the UPX tool in the malware analysis folder, we can load in the file and then decompress it using the GUI.  
CDFD211E3A0E017E8C69453A550E566B  

Question 6  
An executable is not a single file, but rather, has a series of different sections that each have a different role. The number of sections can be used to help fingerprint an executable.  
Note: A packer will produce an executable with a reduced number of sections. Identifying the number of sections in a compressed executable tells you something about the packer, but nothing about the underlying executable. How many sections does the unpacked executable have?  
Nine? That's what I'm seeing in the "PE Sections" section of FileAlyzer. can alsdo be read in the hex  

Question 7  
What is the target Operating System compatibility?   
winders  


Question 8  
Select an import upon which this executable depends.  
__DLLs__  
IAP  
IP Address  
UPX  
We can see this in "PE Imports". All of the files are dlls.  

Question 9  
Which imported DLLs primarily deal with establishing network communications?  
wsock32.dll  

Question 10  
The imports table in an executable articulates not only the DLL that is required, but also the specific functions within the DLL. Which functions in the executable could indicate malicious behavior?  


Question 11  
What is the signature of the file?  
Note: A portable executable has two signatures. The start of the file is often referred to as the "MZ Header." The portable executable (PE) portion of the file also has its own signature. Either will be accepted here.  
5A4D / 00004550  

Question 12  
What registry key entry is referenced in the executable that could indicate a method of persistence?  
For Feedback: Use the "strings" capability to identify text in the sample that may be of interest.  
`strings filename > file.txt`  
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run  

Question 13  
Are there any executables referenced in the strings that would warrant concern?  
Yes - build.exe , cleansweep.exe  

Question 14  
There are several other strings that provide information about the executable and its intended functions. What are some of these strings that are particularly interesting?  
Get Tick Count - gets system uptime. Can be used with sophisticated malware to check if it's running in a VM   

Question 15  
What types of activity do you believe may occur if this executable were run?  
Host enumeration, send data to command and control. Establish persistence via run keys.    

Question 16  
If you believe a system was impacted by this executable, what is a filesystem artifact you could analyze to confirm your suspicion?  
cleansweep.exe , build.exe , run key  

Question 17  
Use the VirusTotal.com website and check if this sample has been seen before. Use the following MD5 hash value: 944207B205C5FA4162B31C34309EB1B0.  

Use an AntiVirus vendor's website to read more about this specific sample. Record the URL here.

Question 1  
Calculate the MD5 hash value of the provided "xex" file. Enter the last four digits of the MD5.  
BB7425B82141A1C0F7D60E5106676BB1  

Question 2  
Use the SHA1 value of the "xex" file to search for a sample on VirusTotal.com:  
9dce39ac1bd36d877fdb0025ee88fdaff0627cdb  
What class of malware do most antivirus vendors classify this sample as?  
Trojan  

Question 3  
Use FileAlyzer to review the contents of the "xex" sample. Do you see anything that indicates this sample is packed? If no, type “No.”  
No. Aside from UPX, if you can read strings, it isn't packed. Hex > right click > scan for strings.  There will also be a UPX tab in Filealyzer if it's packed.    

Question 4  
Review the "xex" file's imports. Do any of the imports indicate what this sample does?  
msvcrt.dll - used for memory allocation, file i/o, exception handling  
kernel32.dll - kernel level dll. protected by the hardware.  
Creates files- copies file?  To what end?  

Question 5  
Are there any file references within the "xex" sample that would provide us an indicator of compromise to look for on other systems?  
Give a justification as to why this file reference is an indicator of compromise.  
Hex > Filenames.  

Question 6  
Are there any network-related references in the "xex" sample that could be useful as an indicator of compromise to search for network-based command and control?  
If yes, give the filename. If there are no file references, enter "No."  
Are there any IP or domain names?  These would be seen in strings if they existed.  

Question 7  
Turn your attention to the "dllxx" file now. Continue your static analysis of this file using the same approaches used for the "xex" sample file. Calculate the MD5 hash value of the provided "dllxx" file. Enter the last 4 digits of the MD5.  
290934C61DE9176AD682FFDD65F0A669

Question 8  
Use the SHA1 value of the "dllxx" file to search for a sample on VirusTotal.com:  
a4b35de71ca20fe776dc72d12fb2886736f43c22  
What class of malware do most antivirus vendors classify this sample as?  

Question 9  
Use FileAlyzer 2 to review the contents of the "dllxx" sample. Do you see anything that indicates this sample is packed?  
No  

Question 10  
Review the "dllxx" file's imports. Do any of the imports indicate what this sample does?   
Creates a process and mutex, opens mutex.  

Question 11  
Are there any file references within the "dllxx" sample that would provide us an indicator of compromise to look for on other systems? If there are no file references, enter "No."  
No(?)  

Question 12  
Are there any network-related references in the "dllxx" sample that could be useful as an indicator of compromise or to search for network-based command and control?  

If yes, give the remote IP address for the malware.  
If there are no network references, enter "No."
