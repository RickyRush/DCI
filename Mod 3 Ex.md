![Alt text](image/ex3-2map2.png)

Question 6  
You are in Workgroup 1 and the following actions occur:

You connect to your internal SharePoint and download a document.
You email it to a coworker in Workgroup 2. (Assume coworker pulled email)
Your coworker proceeds to upload it to the webserver.

Follow the path of the network traffic that was created and count the number of hops. What is the total number of hops? (Hops include routers and endpoints.)

13 hops  

Question 7  
Does Workgroup 2 have access to Workgroup 3?  
Yes, the VPN connection between D and C allows access to Workgroup 3.  

Question 8  
Workgroup 1 and 2 want to create an FTP server and a database that both are allowed to access but would not allow access to Workgroup 3.  

What would be the best way to accomplish this?
Connect a firewall internal to G, connect a switch to that firewall, and connect the FTP server and database to the switch. (As the VPN connection would be coming inbound the firewall could block all inbound VPN traffic)  

Question 9   
By analyzing web traffic at Routers A and B, it is discovered that ransomware was attempted to be delivered by exploiting a vulnerability in version 1.0.2.8 Firewall OS. Firewall C had not been updated before the attack, but Firewall D was updated. Using the provided diagram, determine what workgroups could be affected by the attack.  
Only Workgroup 3 could be affected because the firewall D was updated.  

Question 10  
A Workgroup 1 user is downloading a file from Workgroup 3 with no issue, however, a user from Workgroup 3 is unable to download a file from Workgroup 1. Workgroup 1 is also not able to access the internet. What is most likely the issue?  
Workgroup 1 switch is misconfigured.

### Scenario 1  
---
An internal workstation was identified as having accessed unauthorized documents on an internal file server on the network. The customer wants to monitor the workstation for anymore unauthorized activity.  

IP Address: 192.168.100.34  

MAC Address: 00:01:33:FA:B1:03  

Question 31  
List the possible locations for sensor placement and the problems or considerations at each location.  
Router 1 - Will see all traffic  
Switch 4 - will only monitor the servers  
switch 2 - will monitor all workstations  
 
Question 32  
Which filter would you place on the sniffer, an IP address or a MAC address? Why?  
IP address. Less volatile/not in flux  

Question 33  
Which ports/protocols would you use?  
Monitor for SMB/FTP/HTTP/TFTP

Question 34  
Based on what is provided, what other questions would you ask the network engineer or the system administrator?


### Scenario 2  
---
The customer has reported that their website has been defaced with anti-government material. The website is hosted on a server that is connected to the DMZ segment of the firewall. Reviewing the IIS logs, there are suspicious web requests from the IP address 214.3.152.67. It is suspected that the defacement came from that IP address. You are in charge of collecting data from the sensors and must decide from which sensors to collect data. Use the document and map provided to answer the following questions.  

Question 35  
What are the possible in-line sensors that you can collect data of value from that is related to the defacement?  
Firewall01 may have logs relating to the incident  

Question 36  
Are there any other sensors of interest? Why?  
No, there are no other sensors  

Question 37  
What additional questions would you ask the network engineer or system administrator?  


### Scenario 3
---
The customer states that a person is using a workstation on Switch 01 and is performing suspicious actions against the Victim Server on Switch 04.  

![Alt text](image/ex3-3map4.png)  

Question 38  
Using the local organic sensors, why is Switch 01 the best placement option?  
If the customer believes the suspicious activity is from Switch 01, tapping here will allow us to receive all traffic from the suspicious hosts.  

Question 39  
If it is determined that the subject has access to a remote VPN account, how does this change the answer for the best placement?  
If the malicious actor has remote access, tapping at Switch01 will no longer allow us to see the relevant traffic.

### Scenario 4
---
The subject is now an unknown attacker coming from the Internet. The arrow pointing to the firewall indicating a bad location is placed in both examples to emphasize that a CPT member should never try to place a network monitor directly into any firewall or router. In this example, both Switch 05 and Switch 03 are good locations to place a monitor.   
![Alt text](image/ex3-3map5.png)  

Question 40   
Why would Switch 05 be a better location to monitor than Switch 03? What could be some benefits of monitoring Switch 03?  
Switch05 will allow us to view all traffic coming into the network from the internet. A benefit of Switch03 is that the traffic will be a more narrow scope allowing us to fixate specifically on the traffic to the servers.  

### Scenario 5
---
An air traffic controller, using workstation 10.5.6.14, recently reported that her system may have been compromised. The user reported that she had been conducting research on the internet when she noticed her cursor acting in an erratic manner. After a few moments, a text file opened on the desktop and the following message was displayed: “You have been hacked!”  
![Alt text](image/ex3-3map6.png)  

Question 41  
Using the network map and the information provided, identify the IP address of the first witness device that may contain data pertaining to this incident.  
10.0.1.1

Question 42  
Using the network map and the information provided, identify the IP address of the second witness device that may contain data pertaining to this incident.  
10.0.1.3  

Question 43  
Using the network map and the information provided, identify the IP address of the third witness device that may contain data pertaining to this incident.  
10.0.1.14

Question 44  
Using the network map and the information provided, identify the IP address of the fourth witness device that may contain data pertaining to this incident.  
10.0.1.4


### Scenario 6
---
You received an alert that someone has been posting fighter maintenance records and images of fighters on a website for civilian military enthusiasts. You examined the images and determined they are pictures of aircraft assigned to Victorville Air Base. You visited the website and were able to verify that an air frame mechanic assigned to the fighter maintenance unit at Victorville Air Base uploaded the information. Upon further investigation, you found evidence of data being exfiltrated from both facility fighter sections. You have been assigned to collect network traffic to determine if any other data is being exfiltrated from the unit.  
![Alt text](image/ex3-3map7.png)

Question 45  
Using the network map and the information provided, identify the IP address of the BEST location to install your network monitor.

### Scenario 1: Ninety-Two Pines Marine Air Ground Base
---
The Equation Group hacking tools were leaked by third party Shadow Brokers. These hacking tools have been used to infect Windows machines worldwide. Yesterday, intelligence officials indicated that several government agency computers and servers have been infected, citing multiple reports of possible breaches targeting Windows 2KR2 Servers and Windows unpatched with remedies. As a result, an initial scan of network traffic and firewall logs (10.0.1.18) found that a host machine (10.57.4.3) is sending/receiving encrypted traffic to/from the 10.57.6.131 (server). Additionally, firewall logs from (10.0.1.18) indicate 445 traffic from the server IP to the host IP.  

Restrictions  
The supported commander does not want any network downtime.  

Simulated Equipment
- 1/10/100G in-line splitter
- 10 GB network tap
- 100/1000 copper Ethernet cables
- 1 x 24 port switch (auto sensing, 10/100/1000 Mbps, video-streaming capable)
- 1 x router
- Supported command's local resources

![Alt text](image/ex3-4map1.png)

Question 1  
Private Hawker, located at Ninety-Two Pines Marine Air Ground Base, wants to either tap the router at 10.0.1.11 or reconfigure the IDS to do full capture. What are the pros and cons of each course of action?  
TAP router is off the table - customer does not want downtime. Adding a SPAN port on the router will get the job done. They already have a SPAN to the IDS - why can't we just plug in there?

About the full capture - works great, lives off the land. BUT requires loads of space.  


Question 2  
What is the purpose of capturing traffic on switch 10.0.1.10, since the packet from the host to the server does not ever transverse to that switch? Why do we want to see traffic from the external internet and internal devices?  
The C2 MUST be external


Question 3  
Private Hawker wants to know if tapping that port mirror/span port line between 10.0.1.10 and 10.0.1.14 will cause any network downtime. Would tapping that line cause network downtime? Why or Why not?  
Yes, tapping will cause network downtime


Question 4  
Private Hawker states that she wants to configure a span port on switch 10.57.4.2. Would this be a good idea? Why or Why not?  
No - we have limited taps and this is a waste

Question 5  
Private Hawker wants to configure a span port on switch 10.57.6.2. What information would this provide you as an analyst?  
This would provide traffic going to/from the servers


Question 6   
Private Hawker wants to use and configure the HBSS on the .3 host machine (local defender’s software) in order to monitor for threat activity. Why would it be important to use organic capabilities before we use our own?  
If we use our own tools, the threat actor may notice the change in the network  


Question 7  
Private Hawker wants to know why she has to monitor the network and make observations instead of immediately removing the malware from the host machine. Why is it important to monitor the network and make observations before containing and eradicating the malicious actor’s activity?  
You can only be sure the malware didn't replicate or the actor didn't move laterally if you watch the traffic. We need to monitor it. Triage it.    



### Scenario 2
---
The DCI intelligence analyst has found an intel report from NSA NTOC. The report suggests that a foreign cyber espionage organization has possibly compromised the Ninety-Two Pines Marine Air Ground Base classified network. The whole base is currently supporting a mission that requires 24-hour operations. The intelligence report is provided below, along with other guidance for this scenario.  

Question 8  
Private Hawker doesn't have any experience in a live network intrusion. Based on the information previously given, provide a sensor strategy describing the best location to place new sensors and which local resources will be re-purposed/configured.

Develop a sensor strategy describing the best location to place new sensors and which local resources will be re-purposed/configured in the space below. Your sensor strategy can be written below in any template or format you want. Pay special attention to the impact of your decisions. Thoroughly explain why you are making these changes in the sensor strategy.  




### Scenario 3
---
A new threat report issued by Mandiant Cyber Security Consulting Services | FireEye regarding new TTPs for APT1 was released today. According to Mandiant’s investigation, for the past five months, APT1 has gained access and compromised several DoD organizations. During the last two months, APT1 has been observed stealing 10.5 GB of compressed data from several technology- and DoD-contracting companies that support the U. S. Military Weapons Program. This also includes APT1’s compromise of PROJECT REAPER networks, which includes emails and sensitive documents for the U.S. Long Range Stealth Strike Bomber (LRSS-B) and U.S. Navy Advanced Attack Submarine SSN(X).  

As a result, several Cyber Protection teams have been ordered to ensure all critical infrastructure assets are protected, and to search for APT1 IOCs on the network. The supported command has provided a network map with their mission critical assets highlighted in RED. The CTE team has provided an APT1-specific attack diagram with the most likely course of action.  

Question 9  
Using the map and based on the COA 1 in the attack diagram provided by the CTE team, what is the best sensor placement position, if your team only has two network sensors? Why?  


Question 10  
Using the same resources, what is the best sensor placement position if your team only has one network sensor? Why?  



Question 11  
Using the same resources, what is the best sensor placement position, if your team only has one network sensor and two host sensors? Why?
