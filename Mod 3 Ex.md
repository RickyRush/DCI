Question 1  
Does Workgroup 1 have access to the Web Server (www in DMZ)?  
Yes!  

Question 2  
Does the Web Server in the DMZ have access to Workgroup 1?  
No!  

Question 3  
What is the purpose of Firewall B?  
To block all inbound traffic except for ports used by www, db, and email

Question 4  
What is the purpose of Firewall D?  
To block all inbound traffic  

Question 5  
A coworker in Workgroup 3 needs to send out an email to a coworker in Workgroup 1. What is the correct series of traffic network devices for this email to be sent and then received by the coworker?  
H, G, E, D, A, B, C, C, B, A, D, E, G

Question 6  
You are in Workgroup 1 and the following actions occur:

You connect to your internal SharePoint and download a document.
You email it to a coworker in Workgroup 2. (Assume coworker pulled email)
Your coworker proceeds to upload it to the webserver.

Follow the path of the network traffic that was created and count the number of hops. What is the total number of hops? (Hops include routers and endpoints.)

13 hops  

Question 7  
Does Workgroup 2 have access to Workgroup 3?  
Yes, the VPN connection between D and C allows access to Workgroup 3.  

Question 8  
Workgroup 1 and 2 want to create an FTP server and a database that both are allowed to access but would not allow access to Workgroup 3.  

What would be the best way to accomplish this?
Connect a firewall internal to G, connect a switch to that firewall, and connect the FTP server and database to the switch. (As the VPN connection would be coming inbound the firewall could block all inbound VPN traffic)  

Question 9   
By analyzing web traffic at Routers A and B, it is discovered that ransomware was attempted to be delivered by exploiting a vulnerability in version 1.0.2.8 Firewall OS. Firewall C had not been updated before the attack, but Firewall D was updated. Using the provided diagram, determine what workgroups could be affected by the attack.  
Only Workgroup 3 could be affected because the firewall D was updated.  

Question 10  
A Workgroup 1 user is downloading a file from Workgroup 3 with no issue, however, a user from Workgroup 3 is unable to download a file from Workgroup 1. Workgroup 1 is also not able to access the internet. What is most likely the issue?  
Workgroup 1 switch is misconfigured.

### Scenario 1  
---
An internal workstation was identified as having accessed unauthorized documents on an internal file server on the network. The customer wants to monitor the workstation for anymore unauthorized activity.  

IP Address: 192.168.100.34  

MAC Address: 00:01:33:FA:B1:03  

Question 31  
List the possible locations for sensor placement and the problems or considerations at each location.  
Router 1 - Will see all traffic  
Switch 4 - will only monitor the servers  
switch 2 - will monitor all workstations  
 
Question 32  
Which filter would you place on the sniffer, an IP address or a MAC address? Why?  
IP address. Less volatile/not in flux  

Question 33  
Which ports/protocols would you use?  
Monitor for SMB/FTP

Question 34  
Based on what is provided, what other questions would you ask the network engineer or the system administrator?


### Scenario 2  
---
The customer has reported that their website has been defaced with anti-government material. The website is hosted on a server that is connected to the DMZ segment of the firewall. Reviewing the IIS logs, there are suspicious web requests from the IP address 214.3.152.67. It is suspected that the defacement came from that IP address. You are in charge of collecting data from the sensors and must decide from which sensors to collect data. Use the document and map provided to answer the following questions.  

Question 35  
What are the possible in-line sensors that you can collect data of value from that is related to the defacement?  
Firewall01 may have logs relating to the incident  

Question 36  
Are there any other sensors of interest? Why?  
No, there are no other sensors  

Question 37  
What additional questions would you ask the network engineer or system administrator?  


### Scenario 3
---
The customer states that a person is using a workstation on Switch 01 and is performing suspicious actions against the Victim Server on Switch 04.  

![Alt text](image\ex3-3map4.png)  

Question 38  
Using the local organic sensors, why is Switch 01 the best placement option?  
If the customer believes the suspicious activity is from Switch 01, tapping here will allow us to receive all traffic from the suspicious hosts.  

Question 39  
If it is determined that the subject has access to a remote VPN account, how does this change the answer for the best placement?  
If the malicious actor has remote access, tapping at Switch01 will no longer allow us to see the relevant traffic.

### Scenario 4
---
The subject is now an unknown attacker coming from the Internet. The arrow pointing to the firewall indicating a bad location is placed in both examples to emphasize that a CPT member should never try to place a network monitor directly into any firewall or router. In this example, both Switch 05 and Switch 03 are good locations to place a monitor.   
![Alt text](image\image\ex3-3map5.png)  

Question 40   
Why would Switch 05 be a better location to monitor than Switch 03? What could be some benefits of monitoring Switch 03?  
Switch05 will allow us to view all traffic coming into the network from the internet. A benefit of Switch03 is that the traffic will be a more narrow scope allowing us to fixate specifically on the traffic to the servers.  

### Scenario 5
