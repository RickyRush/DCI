# Mod 5 Exercise Notes
---

## Exercise 5-1-1 Provide Situation Report, Timeline and Operator Log of Activity.  
---

__Scenario__

The USCYBERCOM Commander is on-site. They have requested a brief to them and the supported command that explains what has happened so far. Due to the limited time, the CND Manager is going to ask you questions in order to understand the full picture before the briefing. These questions will be drawn from your previous exercises, and the information you possess will be used to complete the situation report (SITREP), timeline and this brief. If you have Operator Logs, they may be of significant use to you during this exercise.

The DCI CND manager is gathering information from each member of the DCI team. They are asking you, as the senior DCI member, to clarify some events that have happened during the mission before the brief.

__Background__

SITREPs are usually reported every 24-72 hours to higher headquarters (HHQ). These reports give insight to what has happened in the last 24, 48 or 72 hours and what is planned for the next 24, 48 or 72 hours.

Timelines help everyone understand what activity was recorded during an incident response, detailing the malicious activity from first seen to current findings. It is used to continue campaign analysis against an adversary and help future operations stop the malicious activity at the initial compromise stage of a kill chain. 

The operator log is a wealth of information. It can be used for de-confliction between the CPT and supported command. It also allows a greater understanding between the CPT members who are working shifts, because the log details every action taken on any machine. Operator logs also provide training to junior members with little or no experience. It allows those members to understand the flow of a mission and what commands or tools were used to accomplish each task. 



Action Summary  

Collect your previously saved operator logs for exercises.

## Exercise 5-1-2 Provide SITREP and IOCs Identified for NETOPS  
---

__Scenario__

The USCYBERCOM commander is on-site. You have been requested to develop a timeline of DCI team activity and provide a SITREP to NETOPS. Your experiences and notes from previously completed exercises will be used to complete the SITREP and timeline.

__Background__

SITREPs are usually reported every 24-72 hours to higher headquarters (HHQ). These reports give insight to what has happened in the last 24, 48 or 72 hours and what is planned for the next 24, 48 or 72 hours.

Timelines help all stakeholders understand activities that occurred during an incident response; detailing the malicious activity from first sight up to current findings and actions. Timelines are used to perform campaign analysis about an adversary and help future operations stop this malicious activity at earlier stages of the Cyber Kill Chain.

The operator log is a wealth of information. It can be used for de-confliction between the CPT and supported command. It also allows a greater understanding between the CPT members who are working shifts because the log details every action taken on any machine. Operator logs also provide training to junior members with no experience. It allows those members to understand the flow of a mission and what commands or tools were used to accomplish each task.

__Action Summary__

Collect your previously saved operator logs for exercises.

The DCI CND Manager needs you to complete a SITREP that will be sent to leadership who will forward it to NETOPS. The SITREP should include any significant findings detailing the true positive found. It also broadly details the actions conducted in the last 72 hours. The next 72 hours will be filled out by the DCI CND Manager. Using the SITREP example, in a group of no more than three people, complete a SITREP, detailing actions conducted once the true positive IOCs were found.  

Question 12   
Your supported NETOPS chain of command needs a SITREP of activity you have completed over the last 24 hours. Use the template to develop a SITREP and submit it here.  

__Note:__ You will be graded on the content in, not the layout of, the SITREP.  


```
LAST 24 HOURS
